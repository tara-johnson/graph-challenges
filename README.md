# Graph Challenges

## Implement a breadth-first traversal on a graph.
Extend your graph object with a method called breadthFirstTraversal that accepts a starting node. Return a collection of nodes in the order they were visited. Display the collection.

Example:

Input
```
Pandora--------------Arendelle
                     /      \
                    /        \
            Metroville ----- Monstropolis
             /     \            /
            /       \          /
           /         \        /
        Narnia----------Naboo
```
Output
```
Pandora, Arendelle, Metroville, Monstropolis, Narnia, Naboo
```
